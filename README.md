# An-Automatic-Inspection-Conveying-and-Sorting-System-Implementation.
The apparatus used for this project consists of 3 main sections: The inspection station, Conveying subsystem and the Sorting subsystem. These systems work synergically to achieve the task of accurately sorting different objects with unique characteristics over an optimal period. The collaborative working of these subsystems to achieve a common goal of sorting the objects makes this project particularly exciting yet challenging.
This project is a combination of hardware interfacing and software programming using embedded systems to control the physical operations of the system. The hardware part of the project comprises the electrical wiring of the microcontroller and the interfacing of actuators and sensors to the microcontroller unit. The software side involves the programming of the microcontroller using C programming language, application of some built-in microcontroller components such as timers, analog-to-digital converters and working with Integrated Development Environment for software writing and testing.
